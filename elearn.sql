(2,'Aberration ','Aberration is the inability of light entering the eye to converge on the retina. This condition is perceived as distortion and is usually associated with astigmatism. '),
(3,'Ablation','Ablation is the surgical removal or excision of a diseased body part or tissue.'),
(4,'Abscess','Abscess is localised collection of pus, that develops as an immune reaction to infection. The skin surrounding the inflamed area is usually red and painful.'),
(5,'Accessory genes','Accessory genes are additional genes present in viruses and bacteria, which perform additional functions to the cells. These genes are not essential for the normal development of micro-organisms. The accessory genes present in HIV are tat, Rev, Nef, Vif, Vpr, Vpu, Vpx, and the long terminal repeats (LTRs). These genes help in HIV replication, cell to cell transmission, virion assembly, release etc. In addition, LTRs contain both promoter (i.e., enhancer) and suppressing elements that influence viral transcription.'),
(6,'Accommodation','Accommodation refers to the flexibility of eye lens to change its shape while viewing objects at different distances.'),
(7,'Accommodation disorder','Accommodation disorder is the inability of the eye to change focus from one distance to another. This results from decreased elasticity of the lens in the eye. There are three major accommodation disorders. They are Myopia or short-sightedness wherein the image gets focused in front of the retina and hypertropia or long-sightedness that results from image getting focused behind the retina. The third condition astigmatism is the absence of sharp focus.'),

Another action of ACE inhibitors lowering blood pressure is the prevention of bradykinin breakdown leading to bradykinin stimulated endothelial release of vasodilating agents (nitric oxide and prostacyclin).

But, rods, which are basically for dark-adapted vision, do not provide colour vision or good detailed vision, and are very sensitive to bright light. Hence individuals with achromatopsia are totally or almost totally colour blind and have hazy vision or their vision is completely washed out in daylight. '),

These functions of ACE are utilized to treat hypertension.'),
(120,'Angiotensin I','Angiotensin I is produced by the action of renin on angiotensinogen produced by hepatocytes. Decreased intra-renal blood pressure and/or reduction in sodium and chlorine transport to the macula-densa influences the production of angiotensin I. It exists as a precursor to angiotensin II, an active component of RAAS cascade.'),

Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by stimulating the smooth muscles of capillaries and causing vasoconstriction; and also regulates fluid balance. Since angiotensin II has a half-life of 30 seconds, it is broken down into angiotensin III by the action of enzymes called angiotensinases present in red blood cells and tissue capillaries.
